            Taking your friend sightseeing and having him do some exercise is something that makes you proud! Check out the following five things you probably did not know about dog walking. Read and become a pro dog walker. Walk in front of your dogWhen walking your dog, he should walk next to you or behind you. To him, the one walking in front is the leader of the pack. If, on the other hand, he walks in front and leads you, he will be the leader of the pack. This might not be good for you and your dog. You should be the first one going out and the first one entering after a walk.

            Use a short leash
            This is crucial to a better control. Depending on the dog breed, we do not recommend you start him on a retractable leash, for example.  Attach the leash to the very top of the neck to better communicate, guide, and correct your dog.

            Reward your dog during the walk
            When you decide that your dog has been behaving and keeping himself correctly on track, reward him by giving him some time to move around more freely and sniff around. Then you decide when the rewarding time is over. This time should always be less than the time focused on the walk. Your dog should start moving at your command.

            Be a responsible dog walker
            Every time you go out dog walking, don’t forget to take a bag with your in order to pick up after your dog. Dogs will usually take advantage of the moment to relieve themselves, which is why it is important that you bring a bag to pick up after him.

            Meet your dog’s walking needs
            Dogs need to exercise through walking and should also be entertained. A boring dog will usually become destructive and bark a lot. The exercise needs of dogs vary depending on the breed. Find out what are the exercise needs of your dog’s particular breed and make your best effort to meet them.

            In Dogalize we have information on many dog breeds. But we also have so much information and resources for you to take a look at. Visit us to learn more.

            This is a question that can be answered by carefully observing your dog. However, there is not really a dead conclusive evidence of whether this particular dog dominant or submissive. Dogs have varying inclinations towards it and if you are asked, “Is your dog dominant or submissive?‘ people expect you to know for sure.

            One thing that must be clear to you is that when it comes to you, the dog must recognize you as the leader of the pack. Even the youngest member of the house should be seen in a higher rank by your dog. This will avoid behavioral problems in the future.

            To know for sure if your dog is dominant or submissive, you should allow him to socially interact with other dogs and observe his behavior.

            Is your dog dominant?
            The following are some signs that will help you determine if your dog is dominant or submissive:

            He usually gets the attention of the other dogs, even if he doesn’t want it.
            Makes his way to the front whenever a pack is walking in line.
            Mounts other dogs, males and females the same.
            Makes other dogs wait for him.
            Guards and protects toys and steals food from other dogs.
            Starts staring games with other dogs and wins them all the time.
            Never licks other dogs on the mouth.
            A dog that considers himself dominant will make a physical stand for it. They will always stand up straight, even on their toes if necessary. His body is stiff and his ears are standing up and forward.

            Is your dog submissive?
            Check for the following signs of a submissive dog:

            Provides attention and care to other dogs, mostly by licking their mouths.
            If another dog comes to eat their food, they will just walk away.
            A dog startes and they put their face down.
            Rolls on his back to show his belly.
            Submissive dogs are usually easier to train as they understand their ranking position at home. Now, is your dog dominant? In that case, you will have to work on him a little more.

            Knowing if your dog is dominant or submissive will aslo help you guide yourself towards socialzing him with other dogs.

            The initial treatment will conclude with an intravenous. If the cat has spent two or three days with no food, a feeding tube might be placed.
